Move a batch of files into folders
==============

This program accepts a file path and a number of your choice for how many
files to split into folders.

eg: If you have 1000 files and need 100 files per folder, then enter 100 as
the number, and this program will create 10 folders and move 100 files into
each.

# Usage
At the command line, execute the script with an optional 2 arguments. If the arguments are not provided, the script will prompt you to provide them.
```bash
./batch-folders.rb path/to/folder 10
```
